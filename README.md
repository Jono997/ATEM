# ATEM
A collection of extension methods for C# applications that I find myself commonly writing in the majority of my projects. Due to commonly writing these in my projects, I finally decided to write a proper class library containing the extension methods and thus, the creation of ATEM (All The Extension Methods) began.
No creditting of me is necessary, but do feel free to send pull requests with your own extension methods to add.
